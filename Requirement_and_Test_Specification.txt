Soundex Algorithm Overview:
The Soundex algorithm improves search accuracy by encoding words into a letter followed by three digits. It is especially useful for handling misspellings. 

The encoding rules are as follows:
	- Retain the first letter.
	- Ignore: a, e, i, o, u, y, h, w (except for the first letter).
	- Replace consonants with digits:
		b, f, p, v: 1
		c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z: 2
		d, t: 3
		l: 4
		m, n: 5
		r: 6
	- If two adjacent letters encode to the same number, treat them as a single number. 
	  Also, this rule applies if two letters with the same number are separated by h or w, but not by a vowel.
	  Stop when you have one letter followed by three digits. Zero-pad if needed.
	  

Unit Testing:
	Public Interface : generateSoundex
	Verification: Verify that the output matches the expected Soundex code for each test case.
	
Test Cases:

1. Test Case Name: HandlesEmptyInputString  
   Scenario: Handles empty input.  
   Given input: "" (empty string)  
   Expected output: "" (empty string)

2. Test Case Name: Single non alphabetic character  
   Scenario:   
   Given input: "1"  
   Expected output: ""
